This project is a part of the Module 6 challenge in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics BootCamp and is written entirely by the author of the repository. This README template is from the Data Science Working Group.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create an application for obtaining information from both the OpenWeather map API and Geoapify's Places API in order to find ideal destination vacation spots based on current weather statistics. Our application identified a variety of cities meeting the exact desired weather conditions and the corresponding closest hotel within 10,000 meters (6.21mi) of the city to stay in.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Correlation Statistics
* Regression Modeling
* API Requests

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Hvplot
* [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [Geoapify API](https://www.geoapify.com/)

## Project Description
The data source for this project comes from the OpenWeather API and the Geoapify Places API for current weather data and information pertaining to locations on a map. This application functions to combine compiled current weather data for specific coordinates with information about the given coordinates to output hotels in locations that meet specified weather criteria. In short, the application would benefit a potential vacation planning company or serve as a personal vacation planner.
